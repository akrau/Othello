In the player class, we have the doMove function, which can either run a 2ply minimax, or a weighted heuristic function, depending on the value of testminimax. 

We also have a function that is never run that is an AI that completes random valid moves. It was our starting point for the assignment.

********************

Here is what each group member contributed in the past two weeks:

Anise -- most of the rough draft implementation for simple heuristic and minimax in week 1, figuring out the algorithms for each
Clare -- mostly debugging and testing Anise's code, getting AI to work at beginning, implementing clock, attempted recursive minimax but stopped, attempted negamax

********************

Strategies and improvements:

We attempted a recursive minimax, which would allow us to go to depths beyond 2, but we didn't have time to make it work. We also attempted negamax
